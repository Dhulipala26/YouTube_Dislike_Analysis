# YouTube Video Dislikes Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of YouTube videos to uncover insights into the factors that affect the number of dislikes a video receives. Using Python and various data analysis libraries, the project performs detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), handles missing data, and applies statistical techniques to derive meaningful conclusions. The analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to follow and understand.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**: Load the dataset and display the top and bottom records.
- **Data Information and Types**: Check the data types and shape of the dataset, and write inferences.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Calculate the percentage of missing values, and decide whether to drop or impute them.
- **Statistical Summary**: Provide a statistical summary of both numerical and categorical columns and write inferences.
- **Univariate Analysis**: Perform univariate analysis on key columns like view count, likes, dislikes, and comment count.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Analyze relationships between different pairs of columns to identify trends and correlations.
- **Visualization**: Use various plots to visualize the data and the results of the analysis.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Calculate and visualize the correlation between the number of views and dislikes.
- **Month-wise Analysis**: Extract and analyze information about videos published in a specific month (January).
- **Conclusions**: Summarize the findings and insights from the analysis.
